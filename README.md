# OCR Segmentation and Text Extraction (English + Hindi)
This project is designed to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images containing text in both English and Hindi. The script processes the image by segmenting it into blocks, enhancing the quality for better text extraction, and finally extracting the text using Tesseract OCR.
